        <p>
        	The game is played with 5 dice with a scoreboard with different combos. 
            The goal of the game is to get the highest score possible. 
            The first six rounds you can gain points in the following list.
            During your turn you throw your five dice once and choose in which 
            of the six categories that you want points.
        </p>
        <ul>
        	<li>Ones</li>
            <li>Twos</li>
            <li>Threes</li>
            <li>Fours</li>
            <li>Fives</li>
            <li>Sixes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        	After the first six rounds if you have 63 or more points after the 
            first half you'll gain a bonus of fifty. Now the second half starts
            and thus we have now combos.
